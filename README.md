# SelfCareApp

Mood Buddy is the first iOS app that I've developed. It is a self care app that people can use daily to take care of their mental/ emotional health. In version 1, I aim to complete soothing music, exercises, and mood journal features. In future versions, I aim to add meditations and reading materials, which are both content-heavy.
